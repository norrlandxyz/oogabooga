	- Player volume control

		- Spam simd
		- Concurrent jobs for players?
		- Mega buffer for contiguous intermediate buffers
			We definitely also want a limit to how much memory we want allocated to intermediate buffers.
	- Avoid playing identical audio at the same time
	- Custom audio mixing
	- Fix vorbis >FILE< streaming (#StbVorbisFileStream)
	- Handle audio sources which had their format defaulted to update when default device changes
		For streamed audio sources this should be easy enough, because the conversion happens from raw format to source format as we stream it.
		For loaded sources though, we would need to convert the source->pcm_frames.
	- Bugs:
		- Small fadeout on pause is slightly noisy
		- Setting time stamp/progression causes noise (need fade transition like on pause/play)
		- End of clip also causes noise if audio clip does not end smoothly
		- Setting audio source to a format which differs from audio output format in both channels and bit_width at the same time will produce pure loud noise.
		- 24-Bit audio conversion doesn't really work

- Needs testing:
	- Audio format channel conversions
	- sample rate downsampling
	- non stereo or mono audio
